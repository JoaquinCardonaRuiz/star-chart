# StarChart
**StarChart** is a WIP 4X turn-based CLI strategy game being developed in Python since 2018.

The game pits two players against each other for control of a procedurally generated star system, where, starting on opposite ends, they must seize the resources on the planets on their side, and vie for domination of the central bodies, mastering extraction, production, and combat in order to best their foe.
